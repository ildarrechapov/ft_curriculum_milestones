   Parameters: <servername> <hopcount> <info>

   The server message is used to tell a server that the other end of a
   new connection is a server. This message is also used to pass server
   data over whole net.  When a new server is connected to net,
   information about it be broadcast to the whole network.  <hopcount>
   is used to give all servers some internal information on how far away
   all servers are.  With a full server list, it would be possible to
   construct a map of the entire server tree, but hostmasks prevent this
   from being done.

   The SERVER message must only be accepted from either (a) a connection
   which is yet to be registered and is attempting to register as a
   server, or (b) an existing connection to another server, in  which
   case the SERVER message is introducing a new server behind that
   server.

   Most errors that occur with the receipt of a SERVER command result in
   the connection being terminated by the destination host (target
   SERVER).  Error replies are usually sent using the "ERROR" command
   rather than the numeric since the ERROR command has several useful
   properties which make it useful here.

   If a SERVER message is parsed and attempts to introduce a server
   which is already known to the receiving server, the connection from
   which that message must be closed (following the correct procedures),
   since a duplicate route to a server has formed and the acyclic nature
   of the IRC tree broken.

   Numeric Replies:

           ERR_ALREADYREGISTRED

   Example:

SERVER test.oulu.fi 1 :[tolsun.oulu.fi] Experimental server
                                ; New server test.oulu.fi introducing
                                itself and attempting to register.  The
                                name in []'s is the hostname for the
                                host running test.oulu.fi.


:tolsun.oulu.fi SERVER csd.bu.edu 5 :BU Central Server
                                ; Server tolsun.oulu.fi is our uplink
                                for csd.bu.edu which is 5 hops away.
